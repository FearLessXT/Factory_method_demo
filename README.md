# Factory Method

### Factory Method: 

is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.

This pattern is used when the class that creates an object is determined by an argument or configuration.

In this pattern, the class responsible for creating objects is called a Factory.

In this Repository, we have created a Factory Method for creating a Product.
